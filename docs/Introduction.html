								  <h3>Content</h3>
								  <p>This virtual exhibit will examine not only the Western Front of the war, but most importantly will examine Canada’s and Canadian citizens perspectives on the war at that time, including on the Homefront and from the perspective of Samuel Lewis Honey, a Canadian soldier who fought in the great war..</p>
								  <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
									<p>The goal that this online exhibit is to educate Canadians and not only about the events that occurred, and various perspectives during WWI while limiting bias and including as many various ideas and perspectives as possible.</p>
								  <p>This virtual exhibit strives to be unique from others by conveying ideas in an informative and engaging way. This online exhibit uses digital artifacts (such as.......) and explain their role as well as analyzes their significance to accurately explain different perspectives during the war in the battle and at home with as little bias as possible. It is just like going to a real museum but from the comfort of your home.</p>
								  <h3>Call to Canadians</h3>
									<p>I believe that it is very important for Canadians to visit this virtual museum to learn more about Canada’s role and how it was impacted by WWI, how it came to be a prosperous, influential, and widely known and respected on the world stage. They can also understand more about what it means to be Canadian and how Canadian identity evolved over time. Another important benefit of visiting is learning more about how WWI affected the 20th century but how the effects of this war can still be seen today in areas like the Middle East.</p>
