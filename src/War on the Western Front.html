								  <p>The First World War on the Western Front was unique as a result of several key factors. WWI was one of the first non-mobile wars, prior to its most wars were won or lost relatively quickly because the battles were fought in open areas and there was a clear winner and loser at the end of each direct confrontation between troops. However, during WWI, war strategy changed as such that instead of the battles being mobile as many people predicted and hoped, both sides when faced with a stalemate, dug into the ground creating trenches (hideout/protection shields). This was the beginning of trench warfare which made it significantly difficult to gain ground on either side. This type of warfare lasted for much longer than “traditional” warfare and often in battles there were no clear winners and not much land gained because the trenches provided protection to soldiers. Thus, new innovative methods of attack and defence needed to be invented, creating a boom of new technologies to be used on the battlefield (i.e. artillery, grenades, war planes, etc.). Overall, World War One introduced new strategies and technologies of fighting a war, a much more deadly, scarring and bloody mode of fighting. I chose these artifacts because they outline what life was like for soldiers in the trenches and how both sides overcame the stalemate caused by the protection the trenches gave. Overall, my goal in choosing these artifacts was to provide information about the frontline battlefield and strategies and how they compare to the periods before 1914 and today. </p>

											  <h3>Artillery Support</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This picture shows the technological advancement of weapons during the First World War, this one specifically showcasing the artillery gun. WWI was the first non-mobile war and it made military strategists innovate in order to stay ahead of the enemy and gain ground. This picture showcases the artillery gun. The angle of this picture depicts its function, value, and role perfectly. As it is night, one can see the huge explosion created when firing it (huge cloud and lights up surrounding areas) and one can see soldiers silhouetted in next to a towering piece of metal. It can be inferred that this picture induce fear for the enemies as it is perceived to cause great damage to them. Overall, this photo showcases the message that WWI created a boom in technological advancements, some being positive, while others brought about millions of deaths (i.e. artillery, chlorine gas). This also shows how the war changed from previous wars as it was more static as opposed to the mobile wars of before.</p>

											  <h3>Painting - Capture of the Sugar Factory</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This picture is significant because it gives great insight into the precarious conditions that the soldiers endured during the fight as well as the destruction caused by war. For example, the soldiers are fighting right next to their dead comrades’ body. In addition, it showed how resourceful the soldiers needed to be, taking cover behind anything that could protect them. This picture also shows the use of hand grenades, invented in 1914, which were used to draw out the enemies from their hiding spot and oftentimes killing many from both sides in the process. Overall, this picture shows how traumatic and stressful a battlefield can be for the soldiers. It also showed how closely the soldiers needed to work together, each completing their own task in order to win the battle, one throwing a grenade, the other shooting, one searching for ammunition etc. In addition, this picture also shows the destruction of the landscape, buildings, structures and anything that used to bring wealth and prosperity to people - only dirt/mud on ground, pieces of rubble strewed around on the ground, and ruins of factory in the background.</p>

											  <h3>Diary Entry of Capt. James Patterson</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This fragment from a diary entry (out of 1.5 million pages collected in the WWI archive collection) describes the devastation of war and the pain and suffering a soldier experiences during the war (“The most ghastly day of my life”) and also the soldiers’ moments of glory and pride (“and yet one of my proudest, because my regiment did its job and held on against heavy odds."). The diary entry shows the way that the average soldier would view the battle as well as the devastation the war brings “All the grass trodden in the mud. Holes where shells have struck. Branches torn off trees by explosions”. It also, shows the resiliency and adaptability of the soldiers as they try to make the best of the deplorable situation they are in “Everyone very cheery and making the best out of it. In addition, it depicts the poor living conditions of the soldiers in the trenches - rainwater buildup in trenches that caused trench foot, dead bodies lying everywhere around them, diseases and constant worries and stress that soldiers needed to face while in the trenches – showcasing the huge difference between the mobile wars (prior to WWI) and the more static WWI.</p>

											  <h3>Letter by&nbsp;Lt. Balfour</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This letter, written by a Canadian lieutenant, depicts a different side of the war, the financial side. Lt. Balfour documents in a letter sent to his father the various financial aspects of the war, from digging trenches to purchasing various supplies as well as salaries. Although this aspect of the war is not often documented by soldiers as not many considered the financial aspects and mostly documented their experiences, it is quite important as how much money is invested in the soldiers’ equipment and digging trenches can have significant impacts on the outcome of the battle. It also gives a window into what it was like to live life as a soldier at the time, from a financial perspective. It shows the amount of expenses a soldier needed to make from their own pocket (clothes, toiletries etc.) and how the government helped them financially (describes pay of $2.60/ day and credit/grant availability for soldiers). Overall, this source shows a different perspective on the war and highlights the financials that were powering the war.</p>

									<p>This painting was painted by Fortunino Matania on the 15th of September 1916 during the battle of Somme.  Fortunino Matania was an Italian war painter who was widely known for his very realistic portrayal of WWI trench warfare and not only. This painting was created using only ink on a paper canvas.</p>
